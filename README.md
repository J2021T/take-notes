  ## Description
  Take-notes is an application to write and keep notes for memory assistance purposes.  Everyone has things they want to remember and knows they won't keep all the details without writing them down.  Using a heroku application and express.js a server was created that displays a notes page.  On the notes page a user can add, review, and delete notes.
